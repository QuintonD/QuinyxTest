This assignment focuses on transshipments of a certain port. Each day, many 
vessels arrive in this port and are served by some stevedore(s). Four cargo 
types have been identified (ore, coal, oil, and petroleum), and vessels often 
carry a mixture of cargo types. For each unique vessel arrival (i.e. each row in 
the data), we would like a prediction of how much it transships (total of load & 
discharge activities) per cargo type. Variables of interest therefore are: 
discharge1, load1, discharge2, load2, discharge3, load3, discharge4 and load4.

The data for this case is stored in ‘VesselData.csv’ and contains historical data. 

We would like you to provide us with a Jupyter notebook or Python script with the 
results of your endeavors, well enriched with comments elaborating on the steps 
taken, even if they did not lead you anywhere, and try to motivate your actions as 
much as possible. We would like to understand the approach you have taken and your 
line of thought.
